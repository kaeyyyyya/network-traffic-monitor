This project is a lightweight, command-line-based network toolkit developed in Python on a Kali Linux virtual machine. 
It provides a simplified yet functional set of tools inspired by features commonly found in professional network analyzers like Wireshark. 
The toolkit includes utilities for listing active network interfaces with their IP and MAC addresses, performing connectivity tests via ICMP (ping), scanning for open TCP ports on remote hosts,
and monitoring real-time bandwidth usage (upload/download speeds). Built with Python libraries such as psutil, socket, and subprocess,
this project demonstrates core concepts in network programming and system-level scripting
